**Forge** is an opencode plugin that orchestrates 7 AI agents through a lean software delivery pipeline — from inception to production. It uses Linear as the state spine and runs fully within opencode.

---

## How It Works

1. **Install** — `forge init` drops the plugin, 7 agent definitions, 24 skills, and slash commands into your project's `.opencode/` directory
2. **Authenticate** — `opencode mcp auth linear` connects to your Linear workspace
3. **Start** — `/forge new project` kicks off the 8-phase inception flow
4. **Deliver** — after inception, the plugin polls Linear for stories, claims them, creates agent sessions, and coordinates the delivery pipeline

There is no separate process or daemon. The plugin activates when you run `/forge new project` and stops with `/forge.stop`.

### Plugin Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Dormant** | Default. Plugin is registered but idle — no polling, no sessions. |
| **Inception** | 8-phase discovery: lean canvas → empathy map → trade-off sliders → event storming → UX design → story writing → tech stack → iteration map |
| **Development** | Polls Linear every N seconds for stories in pull states. Claims stories, creates agent sessions, handles handoffs and crash recovery. |

### The Seven Agents

| Agent | Owns |
|---|---|
| **po-agent** | Inception, story writing, backlog, story acceptance |
| **ux-agent** | Empathy mapping, UX specs, design system |
| **architect-agent** | Architecture Decision Records, service boundaries, tech debt |
| **developer-agent** | ATDD loops, TDD inner loops, contract tests, feature flags |
| **qa-agent** | Acceptance test authoring, desk checks, regression suite |
| **devops-agent** | CI/CD, environments, Unleash feature flags, deployments |
| **secops-agent** | Threat modeling, security ACs, SAST/DAST pipeline gates |

Each agent loads its assigned skills at session start. Roles are enforced by skill design — the developer agent doesn't make architecture decisions, and the architect agent doesn't write production code.

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
bun add -g @loopworx/forge
# or: npm install -g @loopworx/forge

# Initialize in your project
cd my-project
forge init

# Authenticate with Linear
opencode mcp auth linear

# Start the inception flow
# (run this inside opencode)
/forge new project
```

`/forge new project` guides you through the initial setup — Linear workspace configuration, team selection, and the 8-phase inception flow. No manual `forge.yaml` editing required for Linear auth.

### What `forge init` installs

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `.opencode/plugins/forge.ts` | The Forge plugin (coordinator) |
| `.opencode/agents/` | 7 agent definitions with skill permissions |
| `.opencode/skills/` | 24 skills (SKILL.md + LOOP.md each) |
| `.opencode/commands/forge/` | Slash commands: `new-project`, `stop`, `status`, `approve` |
| `forge.yaml` | Plugin configuration (poll interval, concurrency, inception phases) |
| `opencode.json` | Linear MCP server config + plugin registration |

## Delivery Pipeline

Stories flow through Linear workflow states:

```
in-analysis → ready-for-dev → in-dev → ready-for-qa → in-qa
  → ready-for-acceptance → in-acceptance → ready-to-deploy → done
```

- **Stories are pulled, not assigned** — the plugin polls for stories in pull states, claims them (pull → active), and creates agent sessions
- **Handoff comments** — agents post compact summaries to Linear via MCP; the next agent reads them as context
- **Failsafe** — if an agent forgets to update Linear state but posted a handoff comment, the plugin auto-advances; if no comment, it halts as `halted-ambiguous`
- **Crash recovery** — on startup, the plugin checks `.forge/sessions.json` for orphaned sessions and re-claims active ones
- **Commit per AC** — after each acceptance criterion goes green, the developer agent commits with `feat({STORY-ID}): AC{n} — {summary}` before desk check

### Delivery Lifecycle

1. **Inception** (8 phases) — PO, UX, and Architect agents facilitate structured discovery
2. **Story Refinement** — Four-gate review: PO drafts → UX value gate → developer feasibility → QA testability
3. **Iteration Zero** — CI/CD, environments, test harness scaffold, feature flags
4. **ATDD Loops** — Outer Acceptance Test RED → sub-slice TDD (FE + BE) → GREEN → desk check
5. **Kanban Flow** — Stories move through the Linear state machine independently
6. **Feature Flags + Trunk-Based CD** — Everything on trunk; unfinished stories behind flags

## Skills Library (24 skills)

**Meta**
- `using-forge` — precedence rules, agent roles, session start protocol
- `resuming-sessions` — query Linear + read CONTEXT.md before anything else

**Discovery** (8-phase inception)
- `facilitating-inception`, `facilitating-event-storming`, `establishing-ubiquitous-language`, `designing-ux`, `writing-stories`, `building-iteration-map`

**Architecture**
- `selecting-tech-stack`, `establishing-architecture`, `deciding-architecture`

**Iteration Zero**
- `bootstrapping-project`, `validating-test-harness`

**Development (L1 Rigid)**
- `running-atdd-sessions`, `running-tdd-loops`, `managing-feature-flags`

**Quality & Acceptance**
- `running-desk-checks`, `writing-acceptance-tests`, `running-regression-suite`
- `approving-stories`, `finishing-stories`

**Security**
- `modeling-threats`, `securing-pipeline`, `guarding-loops`

All 24 skills are verified on every push by [loopkit](https://github.com/loopworx/loopkit) — a static analyzer for agent skill contracts. It validates state transitions, enforced states, handoff references, desk check patterns, bug feedback loops, progressive disclosure, naming conventions, and terminology across every SKILL.md and LOOP.md file.

```bash
# Run locally (requires Rust)
cargo install loopkit
loopkit .
# 24 skills checked. 0 error(s), 0 warning(s). 205 verification(s) ran.
```

## Development

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/loopworx/forge
cd forge
bun install

# Checks
bun run lint       # oxlint — 0 warnings, 0 errors
bun run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
bun test           # 87 tests, 198 expect calls
bun run build      # compile plugin → dist/plugin.js

# Test forge init locally
mkdir /tmp/forge-test && cd /tmp/forge-test
bun run /path/to/forge/bin/forge.ts init
```

### Pipeline

Every push to main runs a single sequential pipeline:

```
build → (typecheck ‖ lint ‖ loopkit) → test → release
```

The release job auto-increments the npm version, publishes, creates a git tag, and generates a GitHub Release with commit history as release notes.
