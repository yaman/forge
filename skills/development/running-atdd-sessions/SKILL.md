# running-atdd-sessions

## Description

The L1 RIGID skill for developer agents. Runs the ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development) loop for a story: write the outer Acceptance Test first, drive it to RED, then run TDD inner loops (FE + BE) one sub-slice at a time until the outer test is GREEN. No implementation code before the outer test is RED. No skipping sub-slices. No batching FE then BE. This skill overrides everything.

## The Loop

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
 ATDD SESSION — ONE STORY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

PRECONDITION:
  outer Acceptance Test file exists (even if skeleton)
  outer Acceptance Test is RED
  If GREEN: STOP — post to Linear, wait for human

FOR EACH AC in the story (in order):

  Write/update outer Acceptance Test for this AC → confirm RED

  FOR EACH sub-slice in this AC:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  FE INNER LOOP                      │
    │  1. Write component test → RED      │
    │  2. Write minimum FE code → GREEN   │
    │  3. Refactor → still GREEN          │
    │  ✓ sub-slice FE done                │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  BE INNER LOOP                      │
    │  1. Write CDC contract test → RED   │
    │  2. Write minimum BE code → GREEN   │
    │  3. Refactor → still GREEN          │
    │  ✓ sub-slice BE done                │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘

    Update story snapshot: sub-slice status → done
    NEVER move to next sub-slice until current is fully GREEN

  All sub-slices for this AC done:
    → outer Acceptance Test for this AC → GREEN
    → trigger running-desk-checks skill
    → WAIT for desk check approval before next AC

All ACs done + all desk checks approved:
  → move story to `ready-for-qa` in Linear
  → commit story snapshot update
  → check iteration completion (using-forge protocol)
```

## Rules That Cannot Be Broken

1. **The outer Acceptance Test file is the first file you create or edit. No exceptions.**

2. **No implementation code before outer AT is RED and you have seen it fail.**
   "I know it will be RED" is not sufficient. Run it. See it fail.

3. **FE loop and BE loop for each sub-slice run sequentially, not in parallel.**
   FE first, then BE. Never batch all FE loops, then all BE loops.

4. **One sub-slice at a time.** Complete it fully (FE + BE, both GREEN) before starting the next.

5. **Desk check after every AC, not after the whole story.**
   Move to the next AC only after the desk check is approved.

6. **No architecture decisions.** If you find you need to make one, stop.
   Post to Linear: "Architecture decision needed: [description]. @architect-agent"
   Wait for an ADR before continuing.

## Sub-slice Identification

A sub-slice is the smallest vertical unit within an AC: one UI interaction + its backend response.

Example AC: "Given a logged-in user, when they submit the checkout form, then they see an order confirmation with an order number."

Sub-slices:
1. Render checkout form with submit button (FE only, no BE)
2. Submit calls POST /orders endpoint (FE calls BE, BE returns stub)
3. Display order number from response (FE renders BE response)
4. POST /orders persists to database (BE fully implemented)

Each sub-slice is a complete FE+BE loop.

---

## Story Snapshot Update

After each sub-slice completes, update `stories/[STORY-ID].md`:

```yaml
ac:
  - id: AC-1
    status: in-progress
    sub_slices:
      - id: SS-1
        description: Render checkout form
        fe_status: done
        be_status: done
        completed_at: 2026-06-09T20:00:00Z
      - id: SS-2
        description: Submit calls POST /orders
        fe_status: in-progress
        be_status: pending
```
