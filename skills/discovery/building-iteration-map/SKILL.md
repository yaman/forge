# building-iteration-map

## Description

Builds the iteration map from the dependency graph of all refined stories. Uses topological sort to assign stories to iterations — stories with no dependencies go first, stories depending on them go next. Creates Linear Projects (one per iteration) and an active Cycle for Iteration 0. This is mechanical execution — no decisions, just the algorithm.

## Algorithm

```
1. Collect all stories that passed gate review (status: in-analysis)
2. For each story, identify dependencies (stories that must complete first)
3. Topological sort:
   Iteration 1 = stories with no dependencies
   Iteration 2 = stories whose only dependencies are in Iteration 1
   Iteration N = stories whose dependencies are all in Iterations 1..N-1
4. Flag stories with circular dependencies as hotspots — do not assign
5. Within each iteration, identify parallel tracks:
   stories with no inter-story dependencies within the iteration = parallel
```

---

## Linear Actions

```
For each iteration N:
  → Create Linear Project: "Iteration N"
  → Add all stories assigned to iteration N to the project
  → Set story dependencies in Linear

Create Iteration 0 Cycle:
  → Add Iteration 0 infrastructure stories
  → Set all to `in-analysis`

Post iteration summary comment on the project milestone:
  "Iteration N: [X] stories, [Y] can run in parallel, [Z] total ACs"
```

## Iteration Scoping Reference

| Concept | Forge equivalent |
|---|---|
| Story points | AC count (1 AC ≈ 1 ATDD loop) |
| Team velocity | Max parallel agents (from project.constraints.yaml) |
| Sprint length | Variable — iteration ends when all stories reach done |
| Scope cut | Split stories with >5 ACs before iteration starts |

## Completion Criteria

This skill is done when:
- [ ] All stories are assigned to an iteration in Linear
- [ ] Linear Projects exist for all iterations
- [ ] Iteration 0 Cycle is active
- [ ] Dependency graph has no unresolved circular dependencies
- [ ] Human has confirmed the iteration map
