# facilitating-event-storming

## Description

Facilitates an interactive event storming session to discover the domain model through conversation. The agent asks questions; the human answers; the agent maps domain events, commands, policies, aggregates, and UI elements. The session ends by generating CONTEXT.md (the ubiquitous language) and a structured event storm artifact. Do not generate stories until event storming is complete.

## The Sticky Colours

| Colour | Represents | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 🟠 Orange | Domain event (past tense) | `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentFailed` |
| 🔵 Blue | Command (imperative) | `PlaceOrder`, `CancelSubscription` |
| 🟣 Purple | Policy ("when X, then Y") | `When PaymentFailed, then NotifyUser` |
| 🟡 Yellow | Aggregate / Actor | `Order`, `Customer`, `PaymentGateway` |
| 🩷 Pink | UI / Read model | `Order Confirmation Screen`, `Invoice PDF` |
| 🔴 Red | Hotspot / ambiguity | Questions to resolve later |

Pink stickies become user stories.
Orange + Blue + Purple become acceptance criteria.

## Session Protocol

### Phase 1 — Chaotic Exploration
> "Tell me what happens in your system. Start anywhere — what's the most important thing that happens?"

- Map every domain event the human mentions (orange)
- Don't organise yet — just capture
- Ask: "What triggers that?" → command (blue)
- Ask: "What happens next?" → next event (orange)
- Mark anything unclear as a hotspot (red)

### Phase 2 — Enforce the Timeline
> "Let's put these in order, left to right, earliest to latest."

- Arrange events on a timeline
- Identify parallel flows
- Surface gaps: "What happens between X and Y?"

### Phase 3 — Add Commands and Actors
- For each event: "What command caused this?"
- For each command: "Who or what issues this command? (human, system, timer, policy)"
- Map actors to aggregates (yellow)

### Phase 4 — Add Policies
- "Are there any automatic reactions? When X happens, does the system automatically do Y?"
- Map as purple policy stickies

### Phase 5 — Add UI / Read Models
- "What does the user see at each step?"
- "What information does the user need to issue this command?"
- Map as pink stickies
- Each pink sticky = one user story candidate

### Phase 6 — Ubiquitous Language (establishing-ubiquitous-language)
- For each aggregate: agree on the canonical name, list synonyms to avoid
- For each key event/command: agree on the canonical verb form
- Document in CONTEXT.md
- Flag ambiguities in CONTEXT.md Flagged Ambiguities section

## Output Artifacts

### `docs/event-storm.yaml`
```yaml
events:
  - id: EVT-001
    name: OrderPlaced
    trigger: PlaceOrder command
    actor: Customer
    aggregate: Order
    policies:
      - When OrderPlaced, notify merchant
    ui: Order Confirmation Screen

bounded_contexts:
  - name: Orders
    aggregates: [Order, OrderLine]
  - name: Payments
    aggregates: [Payment, Invoice]

story_candidates:
  - ui: Order Confirmation Screen
    pain_point: Customer needs confirmation their order was received
    events: [OrderPlaced]
```
