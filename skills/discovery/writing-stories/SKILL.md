# writing-stories

## Description

Writes INVEST-compliant user stories from event storming story candidates, puts them through a four-gate review, and creates them in Linear. A story that fails any gate goes back to the PO — it does not proceed. A story that passes all four gates is created in Linear with status `in-analysis`.

---

## Story Format

```
As a [specific persona from empathy map],
I want to [action],
So that [customer value — traces to a Pain or Gain in the empathy map].

Acceptance Criteria:
  AC-1: Given [context], when [action], then [observable UI outcome]
  AC-2: Given [context], when [action], then [observable UI outcome]
  ...

Feature flag: [feature-flag-name]
Empathy map reference: [Pain/Gain ID from docs/empathy-map.md]
```

## INVEST Checklist

Every story must pass before gate review:
- [ ] **I**ndependent — deliverable without depending on an unfinished story
- [ ] **N**egotiable — ACs describe outcomes, not implementation
- [ ] **V**aluable — customer value is explicit and traces to empathy map
- [ ] **E**stimable — developer agent can assess feasibility
- [ ] **S**mall — completable in a single ATDD session (≤5 ACs; if more, split)
- [ ] **T**estable — every AC is testable through the UI alone, as an outside customer would test

## The Four-Gate Review

### Gate 1 — PO Draft
po-agent writes the story. Checks INVEST. If INVEST fails, rewrites before proceeding.

### Gate 2 — UX Gate
ux-agent reviews:
- Does this trace to a real customer pain in the empathy map?
- Is the persona specific enough?
- Are the ACs from the customer's perspective, not the developer's?

Fail condition: story does not trace to empathy map → back to Gate 1.

### Gate 3 — Developer Gate
developer-agent (or architect-agent) reviews:
- Is this technically feasible?
- Does implementing this require an ADR that doesn't exist yet?
- Are there hidden dependencies not captured in the iteration map?
- Rough AC count — if >5, flag for splitting.

Fail condition: infeasible or needs unwritten ADR → back to Gate 1.

### Gate 4 — QA Gate
qa-agent reviews every AC:
- Is this testable through the UI alone? No database queries, no API calls, no internal state inspection.
- Is the "then" clause observable by an outside user?
- Is the Given/When/Then specific enough to write a Playwright test?

Fail condition: any AC not UI-testable → back to Gate 1.

## On Pass: Create in Linear

```
1. Create story in Linear with status `in-analysis`
2. Assign to current iteration's Project
3. Add ACs as sub-issues (one per AC)
4. Set feature flag name as a Linear property
5. Link empathy map reference in description
6. Commit story snapshot to stories/[STORY-ID].md
```

The story snapshot in the repo is committed at `ready-for-dev` (when the story is locked).
Before that, Linear is the source of truth.
