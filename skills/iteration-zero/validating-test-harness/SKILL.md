# validating-test-harness

## Description

Blocks Iteration 1 until the testing foundation is proven. The first dummy Acceptance Test must run in CI and pass against the test environment. If the harness is flaky, slow, or non-reproducible, Iteration 1 stays closed.

---

## Required Proof

### Dummy acceptance test
Create one trivial end-to-end test that proves the harness works:
- Opens the application
- Verifies a deterministic page element
- Runs in CI
- Runs against test environment

### Pass conditions
- [ ] Test passes locally
- [ ] Test passes in CI
- [ ] Test passes against test environment URL
- [ ] Runtime is acceptable for repeated use
- [ ] Failure output is understandable

### Fail conditions
- Test only passes locally
- Test depends on manual setup
- Test flakes across repeated runs
- CI environment differs materially from test environment

---

## Decision

If all pass conditions hold:
> Post to Linear: "Acceptance test harness validated. Iteration 1 may begin."

If any fail condition holds:
> Post to Linear: "Acceptance test harness NOT validated. Iteration 1 blocked. Reason: [reason]"

Iteration 1 is blocked until validation is green.
